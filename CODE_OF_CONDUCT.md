# Code of Conduct

> This project â€” *Mr. Russky* â€” was created as a friendly and respectful educational tool for learning Russian vocabulary.  
> The name "Mr. Russky" was chosen purely for its catchy and approachable tone. While we acknowledge that the term "Russky" has been used in certain historical contexts with negative connotations, that is **not** the intention here.  
>
> This app is led by a Mexican developer with deep respect and appreciation for the Russian language and its people. The design and use of Cyrillic characters in the logo are meant to be fun and stylized â€” never mocking.  
>
> We welcome all feedback and are committed to adjusting any part of the project that could be misinterpreted or cause discomfort.  
>
> ðŸ’¬ Thank you for helping us maintain an open, inclusive, and respectful learning space.
