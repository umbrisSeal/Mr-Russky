# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is currently under active development. No stable versions have been released yet.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability or unintended behavior, please report it by opening a confidential issue [on the GitHub Issues tab](https://github.com/umbrisSeal/Mr-Russky/issues) or by contacting the maintainer directly via GitHub profile.

## Data Handling

This is a frontend-only educational app. It does **not collect, process, or store personal data** on any server. Any user progress is stored **locally** in the browser using cookies or localStorage and never transmitted externally.

As such, there are currently **no backend or network-related security concerns**. However, we welcome any suggestions or reports that help improve the integrity or safety of the codebase.

## Response Times

Since this is a volunteer-led open source project, response times may vary. However, we aim to address valid security concerns as soon as possible.
